# Check_MK Plugin - Solaris NFS
# Server check already exists for Linux and Aix agents.

# NFS is prone to hangs when it breaks, must use timeout command
# timeout and stat commands are installed as default on Solaris 11
# For Solaris 8/9/10 install GNU coreutils from Unixpackages.com or OpenCSW

# Code Overview
# Set the correct paths for key utils
# Check paths exist and are executable
# Parse mnttab and list NFS mountpoints ignoring /vol which is used by VOLD
# Check status of each nfs file system, wrapped with a timeout of 9 seconds

# Some code taken from Check_MK Linux agent and modified for Solaris
